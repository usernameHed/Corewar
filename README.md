# Corewar

What is it ?
CoreWars is a kind of game: Each design programs and then makes them fight each other (the aim being to 'plant' the opposing program). A battle of programs in a virtual machine !

This game was invented in American universities. It is a programming exercise which was strongly encouraged by the teachers. This is also probably what gave the idea to the first virus programmers, but Corewars remains a programming exercise quite interesting, informative, peaceful, fun and safe.

This corewar is a first year project of an IT school (Epitech).

Here is an exemple of classic display:

I did some upstream research on how to view the game in an innovative way.
This example involves a simplistic particle physics I programmed and developped myself

Graphic rendering !
 - multithread dividing the particle into 4 groups
 - music
 - clean HUD who display informations about the game, progress bar and custom texte (which is not handled by the graphic librairy used for this exercice !)
 - animation and particle
